# Python-Challenge
Disclimer: I did get assistance with my code from askBCS and a tutor. They explained and showed steps to get the proper calculations. 
I started off with my repository,creating my folders and files and got started on PyBank first. 
I was told by a learning assistant that there was a starter code for the module and this helped keep me organized.
I imported the modules and created a path to the csv file.
Then, I caluclated the total months by '+=' to the month_count in order to calculate each row.
Similarily, to calculate the net total of the entire period, I added each rows profit/loss in order to get the total.
Next, I started to caculate the changes in profit/loss and ran into some issues. This is where I started to get help from the ASKBCS chat on slack and my tutor, Kourt Baily.
I learned that in order to calculate the changes in the profit/loss index, you have to get the first value and then the next value in order to get the difference.
Once this was achieved, I created an if statement to get the greatest percent increase and it's date. 
Similarily, for the greatest percent decrease and it's date. 
Then, I was able to get the average changes with the sum of my net change and the len of my net change.
Once all was caluclated and I got the correct outputs, I put everything into an f' string to properly display the output as needed. 
Finally, I had the results exported to a txt.file. 

#PyPoll
Disclaimer:  I got assistance with the pypoll assignment from askBCS, a tutor, and instructor. They explained and showed steps to get the proper calculations. 
Similar to the PyBank, I started with the import of my modules and created a path for my csv file.
Next, I calculated the number of votes casted. 
I created an empty list of candidates (with the help of askbcs and tutor) to add each candidate to the list with an if statement. 
Also within my if statement, it will calculate the total votes of each candidate.
I then created a variable for the winner_votes and made an if statement for the greatest number of votes. 
I struggled along with my instructor and TA how to solve my output. We were not sure where I was going wrong. 
At first my numbers for each candidate was correct and printing the correct answers. 
Then I had issues with getting it to export to a text file with the right layout.
Eventually, my numbers and outputs all changed. 
I did not give up! 
I asked a learning assistant one more time to help sort through my code. 
He helped me and explained that I had an indenting issue for a print statemnt and this was giving me the repetitive percentage and vote. 
I then got my correct numbers back per candidate. 
I wrote each candidate and percent votes and votes in the order I wished for it to be outputed.
